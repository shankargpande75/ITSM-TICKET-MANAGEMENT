# ITSM-TICKET-MANAGEMENT
ABC Tech management is looking for ways to improve the incident management process as recent customer survey results shows that incident management is rated as poor. Machine Learning as way to improve ITSM processes ABC Tech management recently attended Machine Learning conference on ML for ITSM.

## Business Case:
ABC Tech is an mid-size organisation operation in IT-enabled business segment over a decade. On an average ABC Tech receives 22-25k IT incidents/tickets , which were handled to best practice Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) frameworkwith incident management , problem management, change management and configuration management processes. These ITIL practices attained matured process level and a recent audit confirmed that further improvement initiatives may not yield return of investment. ABC Tech management is looking for ways to improve the incident management process as recent customer survey results shows that incident management is rated as poor. Machine Learning as way to improve ITSM processes ABC Tech management recently attended Machine Learning conference on ML for ITSM.Machine learning looks prospective to improve ITSM processes through prediction and automation. They came up with 4 key areas, where ML can help ITSM process in ABC Tech.

## Problem Statement
1) Predicting High Priority Tickets: ABC Tech aims to develop an ML model that can predict high-priority tickets,specifically those categorized as priority 1 and 2. This prediction will allow them to take proactive measures to address issues or incidents before they escalate.

2) Auto-Tagging Tickets: ABC Tech intends to implement a text classification ML model to automatically assign correct priorities and departments to incoming tickets. This automation will reduce reassignment and related delays in ticket handling.

3) Predicting RFC and ITSM Asset Misconfigurations: The organization aims to create predictive models for Request for Change (RFC) and detect potential failures or misconfigurations in ITSM assets. Identifying these issues in advance will help in preventing disruptions and improving overall ITSM asset management.
